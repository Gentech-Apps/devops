## ðŸš€ Deployment Pipelines

### 1. **GitHub Actions Pipelines** (`/deployment-githubactions`)

This folder contains **GitHub Actions** pipeline configurations for automating CI/CD tasks.

- **CI Workflow**: Builds, tests, and deploys applications using GitHub Actions.
- **CD Workflow**: Deploys to various cloud services such as AWS, Azure, etc.

**How to Use**:
1. Copy `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` into your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.
2. Configure required GitHub secrets and variables.
3. Push your changes and GitHub will trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. **GitLab CI/CD Pipelines** (`/deployment-gitlab`)

This folder contains **GitLab CI/CD pipeline configurations** for automating the software delivery process.

- **Basic CI/CD**: A basic workflow to build, test, and deploy your app.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploys containerized applications to Kubernetes clusters.
- **AWS Deployments**: Deploys to AWS services like S3, Elastic Beanstalk, and others.

**How to Use**:
1. Copy the relevant `.gitlab-ci.yml` file into your repository's root directory.
2. Add necessary environment variables in GitLab's CI/CD settings.
3. Push your changes to GitLab and pipelines will trigger automatically.

### 3. **Azure ARM Templates for IaC** (`/IAC-Azure-ARM`)

This folder contains **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates** to automate the deployment of infrastructure on Azure.

- **VM Deployment**: Automates the creation of virtual machines.
- **Storage Account**: Deploys Azure Storage accounts.
- **Networking**: Configures Virtual Networks and Subnets.

**How to Use**:
1. Navigate to the **Azure Portal**.
2. Go to **Create a resource > Deploy a custom template**.
3. Upload the `.json` template and fill in the required parameters (e.g., Resource Group, Location, Template-Specific Values).
4. Review and click **Create** to deploy the resources.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows on GitHub.
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Automates workflows for projects hosted on GitLab.
- **Azure ARM Templates**: Automates infrastructure provisioning on Azure.
- **Docker**: Containerizes applications for easier deployment across environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **AWS**: Cloud services like S3, Elastic Beanstalk, and CloudFront for deploying apps.

## âš¡ Best Practices

- **Environment-Specific Pipelines**: Separate CI/CD jobs for **staging**, **production**, etc.
- **Secure Secrets**: Use GitHub or GitLab CI/CD Variables to securely store sensitive information (API keys, access tokens, etc.).
- **Rollback Strategy**: Ensure your deployments can be rolled back to previous versions in case of failure.
- **Monitor Pipelines**: Track pipeline execution and deployment status in GitHub or GitLab's pipeline page.

With these pipelines and IaC templates, you can automate the full lifecycle of your applications from development to deployment across multiple environments.
